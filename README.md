Okay, here's that review formatted like a GitHub repository README.md file, written from the perspective of a seasoned factory worker.


# "Dual" - A Factory Worker's Two Cents

---

So, I finally got around to watching this film called "Dual." Heard a bit about it. Figured I'd share my thoughts, seeing as I've seen a thing or two in my years on the floor and I know how weird rules and systems can get.

It's not your usual blockbuster, that's for sure. More of a quiet head-scratcher.

## What's the Deal? (Plot Summary, Sort Of)

Alright, picture this: Main character, a lass named Sarah. Gets told she's got a terminal illness, not long to go. Standard sad stuff, right?

But wait. She decides, for her mum and boyfriend, to get one of those "duals" â€“ basically, a clone of herself. The idea is this clone hangs around, makes the transition easier when she's gone. Seems sensible, in a weird, futuristic way. Like training up your replacement before you clock out for good.

Here's where it gets truly messed up, and frankly, reminded me of some of the loopiest policies I've encountered: Sarah recovers. Illness gone. A miracle, I guess.

Now, according to the rules (and oh boy, are there rules), you can't have two of you running around. One has to go. And because the dual has rights after a certain period, they gotta fight to the death. A court-mandated, live-broadcast fight to the death.

So, the rest of the film is Sarah training to fight... herself. Literally. With a grumpy training coach.

## What Stuck With Me (Observations from the Shop Floor)

   The Absurdity: The whole situation is bonkers. Getting a clone, fine. Recovering, great. But then being forced to fight it? It's like when management comes up with a perfectly logical plan, and then adds one completely illogical, maddening step that ruins everything. "Safety first! Also, you must now fight a badger to get your new safety gloves." That kind of logic.
   The Mundane Tone: Everyone talks like they've had a long shift and are just trying to get through the day. The most insane things are discussed with zero emotion. The acting, the dialogue â€“ it's all very flat, very matter-of-fact. It's weirdly relatable. Most days, even when something crazy happens, you just deal with it, because the line's still running.
   Fighting Yourself: This bit made me think. How much are you your habits? Your routine? Your job? If a copy of you does all that, are you still the original? Or have you gotta fight for your own spot? It's deeper than it looks, hidden under all the deadpan weirdness.
   The Training: The training montage bit, though quiet, was great. The trainer, played by Aaron Paul (the bloke from Breaking Bad), is brilliant. Just wants to teach Sarah how to kill her copy, no fuss, no deep philosophy. Pure, practical problem-solving for an insane problem. Reminded me of a grizzled old foreman explaining how to fix a machine that's decided to start singing opera.

## The Folks Involved

Karen Gillan (the main lass, Sarah) had a tough job playing both versions. Pulled it off without making a big fuss about it. You could tell which was which, mostly by how they reacted (or didn't react) to the madness.

Aaron Paul as the trainer was a highlight. Perfect dry delivery.

Riley Stearns, the bloke who made it â€“ he's got a specific style. Likes things quiet, awkward, and darkly funny. If you liked his other film, "The Art of Self-Defense," you'll probably get this one.

## The Bottom Line

"Dual" isn't for everyone. If you want explosions and clear heroes and villains, look elsewhere.

But if you appreciate dark humour, weird concepts, and watching characters navigate a system that's utterly broken but treated as normal, this film delivers. It's funny because it's so bleak and so plausible in its portrayal of bizarre bureaucracy.

It's not a film you'll necessarily love passionately, but it's one that'll stick with you. Makes you think about identity, rules, and maybe just how strange our own world is sometimes, just without the mandatory clone fights (yet).

It's a solid, thought-provoking watch.

## Score

3.5 / 5

Worth your time if you're in the mood for something different and aren't afraid of a little existential dread served with a side of deadpan comedy.
